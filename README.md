In the modern digital era, the terms “Code” and “Coding” have become ubiquitous. From tech to startups, education to entertainment, coding is a fundamental skill driving innovation and powering the digital world. But what exactly is code, and What is code entail? Let’s dive in and explore these concepts

In our real life, to communicate with each other we use different languages such as English, Hindi and Marathi. Similarly, to communicate with computers we use a Binary language/ Binary Code( 0s and 1s) because computers understand 0’s as ‘off’ and 1’s as ‘on’. We can also say that computers use electrical signals, 0s low voltage and 1s high voltage.

Code is basically a set of instructions written in a programming language that computers can understand and execute accordingly. It serves as a communication bridge between humans and machines, allowing us to directly access the action of a computer to perform a particular or specific task and solve problems.


Code can be written in various programming languages such as C, Java, Python and JavaScript which follows a particular syntax, structure and methods that ensures clarity and functionality. By writing a code, developers can manipulate the data, control flow, control hardware and build software that ranges from simple to complex systems, ultimately transforming abstract ideas into digital solutions.

>>>>What are the benefits of computer programming?

Programming is a fascinating and versatile field you can use for so many different things. Here are just a few of the benefits:

Computer programming can be used to create innovative and functional software. Computer programmers can use their creativity to design software that will be useful to people, or that will improve the way that people work. For example, a computer programmer might design a program that analyzes data from medical tests to determine the presence of a particular disease. The program could be used to help doctors diagnose the disease more easily and accurately.
Computers can also be programmed to perform specific tasks using mathematical algorithms and logic. Computer programmers can create programs that use these algorithms to carry out tasks such as sorting data or calculating the results of complex equations.
It can also be used to create websites, games, and other digital content. In this way, computer programs make it possible for people to access a wide range of entertainment and information online. In addition to creating new content, computer programmers can also help improve existing software and applications. They can add new features and options to existing programs to improve the usability and quality of these programs. For example, a programmer could update an existing gaming app to make it easier to use on a smartphone.
These are just a few instances of how computer programming may be utilized to tackle a wide range of real-world issues. There are numerous other ways in which computer programs might benefit society as a whole.

Computer programmers can help to develop new methods and technologies to improve healthcare and research. They can also create fresh approaches to lower energy usage and increase energy efficiency. As you can see, computer programming offers a diverse range of benefits that can help to enhance our everyday lives in numerous ways.

   *Why program?*
   
Computers are all around us in the 21st century, and promise to become even more ubiquitous as time goes on. They are having an ever increasing impact on our lives, and we are becoming less and less able to even conceive of living without them.

As Dr. Charles Severance says in the beginning of his Python for Everybody course, “It is important that we learn to tell these computers what to do rather than just let them increasingly control our lives.”

Information in the 21st century is now overwhelmingly distributed through the Internet and the World Wide Web. We do research, entertain ourselves, make purchases, interact with our government, and study and learn online.

If we aspire to have democratic participation in the world of today, at least a basic understanding of computer programming, what it is and what it can do, and the workings of the Web are essential for all informed citizens.

That, in a nut shell, is what this book is about. It has two goals: to teach you to think like a computer programmer, so that you can better understand what computers are and what they can and can not do, and to help you apply this understanding in creating web applications.

Learning to think like a computer programmer is a good end in itself, since the processes used in computer programming combine some of the most important features of mathematics, engineering, and natural science. Like mathematicians, computer programmers use formal languages to denote ideas (specifically computations). Like engineers, they design things, assembling components into systems and evaluating tradeoffs among alternatives. Like scientists, they observe the behavior of complex systems, form hypotheses, and test predictions.

The single most important skill for a computer programmer is problem solving. Problem solving means the ability to formulate problems, think creatively about solutions, and express a solution clearly and accurately. As it turns out, the process of learning to program is an excellent opportunity to practice problem-solving skills.

So on one level, you will be learning to program, a useful skill in itself. On another level, you will use programming as a means to an end - creating web applications, which can open the door to you to play an active part in building the tools of the information age.

> First, a disclaimer and that disclaimer is that there are two types of people: people that classify people into types of people and those that don’t. For my first few years as a programmer, I didn’t classify other programmers. I thought they were all the same.

>> But I sort of fell into the job, professionally at least, after I had already written code and made money doing it for five years. I didn’t have a degree and taught myself to program. My first job didn’t pay well and everyone who worked there with me was in the same boat. We all learned our skills on our own and had no formal training.

So for those first few years, every programmer I knew was kind of like me. Every one of us got into programming because we wanted to figure out how it worked to create our own cool things. We would learn about some new way of doing something and tell each other about it.

>>> Once I left that job and started working in the corporate world, I began to classify programmers into three different types: The Professional, The Computer Scientist, and The Creator. I also realized that I was never 100% one of the types. I am always some percentage of each. But I always went back to my core type.

*The Creator*

At first, this is what I thought all programmer’s were. Most of the people on my first team got into coding because they wanted to create video games. I got into it because I wanted to be an inventor and thought that inventing would be easier in a virtual environment.

I tend to not be opinionated about the language or framework I use, unless it makes it harder to build a finished product or I am just more familiar with one more than others. I don’t really care what style rules and linting rules need to be applied. Tabs or spaces? That’s an argument for someone else. Give me a standard and I will use it.

To a creator, the results matter the most. I have learned PHP, JavaScript, Python, Golang, C++, and more because that was what was required to finish the project. The first lines of code I wrote in my life wasn’t a toy program or for a coding class. It was an MVP for my first product. I wanted to build something and programming languages were the tools that would help me get that done.

*The Professional*

This type of programmer may be interested in technology on the surface, but doesn’t really care about writing the code. Writing code is just a step on his journey up the corporate ladder. Even programmers with mediocre skills can get paid pretty well because there always seems to be more programmer jobs than programmers to fill them.

When the market crashed in 2008, a lot of people in the financial industry took coding boot camps to get high paying jobs in the tech industry for this reason. Professionals usually become lead developers and then managers or directors and hope to be CTO or CIO eventually.

I have been bitten by the professional bug at times, usually when my side hustles take a hit, but I actually prefer doing the work to having meetings about doing the work. It is also hard for me to be that invested in a business that I don’t have a real stake in. I could fake it and I know a bunch of professionals do, but I would rather work on creating a great product than help create a business that I would only ever get a paycheck from anyway.

*The Computer Scientist*

Every programmer should be concerned that they are writing good code, but for the computer scientist, it is there ultimate goal. These are the programmers that end up creating the languages and frameworks that make our work easier. They can probably get through the Leet type coding tests with flying colors that I have never been able to pass.

I have tried to become a better computer scientist. I have gone through the books on algorithms and data structures and thought I had a grasp on some of them, but then, since I hardly ever used any of that knowledge in my day-to-day work, it sort of evaporated over time. A similar thing has happened with my knowledge of AWS. I have gone to classes, I have used it on the job, but the times when I need that knowledge are so few an far between that I kind of have to learn it all over each time.

A computer scientist might become an architect eventually, the direction I thought I was going. But again with the meetings.

I guess I started think of this when I turned down promotions recently. Where was I going? What was my goal? If a turn down promotions, does that mean I created my own dead-end job? Does the goal of every job have to be moving up or is just getting better at what you do enough?

Or maybe I just need a different mindset. A few years ago, when my own business went down the tubes, I decided to focus on my career as a programmer. I failed once, so maybe I wasn’t cut out for that. Or maybe I just always was and need to fail more to find success there.
